It offers a clear structure as well as ample freedom to adjust to individual needs, starting with learning to be kind to yourself and then expanding this to learn how to be kind to others.</p><p>This guide consists of a eight chapters that follow the eight sessions of the mindfulness-based compassionate living training programme. To enhance the learning experience, this book features accessible transcripts and downloadable audio exercises, as well as worksheets to explore experiences during exercises. It also includes suggestions for deepening practice at the end of each session.</p><p><em>A Practical Guide to Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living</em> explores the science of compassion in an easy-to-understand and comprehensive manner, one which will appeal to both trained professionals and clients, or anyone wishing to deepen their mindfulness practice with ‘heartfulness’.</p><p>From the foreword by <strong>Mark Williams</strong>, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of Oxford, UK...<br><em>It’s not that compassion has been over-sold, but that it has been over-told. Telling people to love may change behavior temporarily, but it has a short half-life. We need a different approach, and this book takes us by the hand and leads us gently away from the mere idea of compassion towards the experience of compassion...<br>Their book guides us through the landscape of our daily lives, offering new perspectives... It helps us explore, step by step, how to reverse the habits of a lifetime, and cultivate compassion that goes both ways, outwards to others, and inwards to refresh and renew the deepest part of ourselves.<br>In deep gratitude to Erik, Frits and Victoria for their work, I warmly commend this book to you.</em></p><p><strong>Other leading authorities in the field say...</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>A practical yet rich guide in living with a wise heart.</em><br><strong>Tara Brach</strong> PhD, meditation teacher, USA.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>From the first page of this book it is clear that Erik and Frits have a burning desire to help people ease the pain in their hearts and minds with their MBCL course. Building on the wonderful work of their first book 'Mindfulness-based Compassionate Living', they have now produced a volume where accessibility is paramount, with the eight-week course clearly laid out to make it easy for the reader to follow and get the most out of their excellent, kind, heart-felt work. They have a gift for synthesising vitally important ideas into an easy-to-follow programme that anyone can access and benefit from. Highly recommended.</em><br><strong>Vidyamala Burch</strong>, co-founder of Breathworks, UK.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living is spreading beautifully into the world and touching lives in transformative ways. This new book makes the work more accessible to everyday people. It offers us a personal training pathway for enabling compassion to emerge in our daily lives. The book is a gift to us all.</em><br><strong>Rebecca Crane</strong> PhD, director of Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University, UK.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>This wonderful guidebook will benefit any reader interested in the healing power of mindful compassion. The authors have dedicated their lives to these teachings and have produced a clear and practical way to integrate the best of science with the insights of the contemplative traditions. I feel this eight-session approach is powerfully innovative and exactly what the world needs right now. I can't recommend this book highly enough.</em><br><strong>Susan Gillis Chapman</strong>, Acharya, Buddhist teacher, Vancouver, Canada.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Erik and Frits have crafted a programme that carefully builds on the learning from mindfulness-based programmes such as MBSR and MBCT. From this foundation, they introduce compassion-based practices explicitly. There is a solid and compelling theoretical base to the programme, which Erik and Frits have thoughtfully adapted to make it particularly relevant for clinical settings. The practices and exercises offer the potential for a thorough exploration of compassion in one’s life. In this practical guide, each week a menu of options is offered with the encouragement to explore and work with what is needed, possible and helpful at any one moment in time. I have a sense I will revisit its delights often.</em><br><strong>Alison Evans</strong> PhD, founder and co-director of the Mindfulness Network UK and core tutor at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University, UK.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>This pragmatic and user-friendly workbook brings forth a powerful integration of compassion practices for people who have some mindfulness experience &quot;under their belts&quot; already. Underpinned by evolutionary understanding of why human beings are so driven to bring hurt to ourselves and others, it provides a supported pathway for people to meet and transform distress, and connect with their capacity to feel and express more kindness and compassion moment by moment in their lives. May many be touched by it!</em><br><strong>Timothea Goddard</strong>, founding director of Openground Mindfulness Programs and Mindfulness Training Institute - Australia and New Zealand.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>This is a thoroughly friendly book, in which the authors show great care and respect for their readers, both service users and professionals. The work is very down-to earth and accessible, including vivid and engaging examples, poems and stories to encourage the reader on this life-changing journey. The Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living course detailed here is closely based on mindfulness with the same experiential method of learning, and deepens that knowledge into heartfulness. I very much enjoyed this book and am sure that many will benefit from it by learning how to make the comfort of compassion for themselves and others an essential, fundamental part of their lives.</em><br><strong>Judith Soulsby</strong>, Senior teacher and trainer with the Centre for Mindfulness Research &amp; Practice, Bangor University, UK.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="bg-primary text-secondary text-center"><div class="xl:container xl:mx-auto text-sm py-2 px-4">&copy; 2012 - 2023, Erik van den Brink.
